##  Whatâ€™s inside

- **Data cleaning** â€“ remove duplicates, fix columns, and handle missing values
- **Feature engineering** â€“ calculate customer age and prep data for modeling
- **Interactive visuals**
  - **Plotly** charts you can hover, zoom, and explore
  - **Folium** maps showing customer locations
- **Machine Learning** â€“ Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KMeans clustering, PCA, and performance metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix
